## 📌 Project Overview

The Aviation FAQ Chatbot allows users to ask questions related to:
- Airports
- Flights
- Passenger services
- Aviation rules and guidelines

The chatbot uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to match user queries with the most relevant answers from an aviation FAQ dataset.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed.
2. Questions are converted into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**.
3. User input is vectorized using the same TF-IDF model.
4. **Cosine similarity** is calculated between the user query and stored questions.
5. The most relevant answer is returned.
